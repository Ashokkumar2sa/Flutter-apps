# Dicee ðŸŽ²

introduced  to the core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most of the apps youâ€™ll build in the future. This app will teach us how to make apps with functionality using setState() inside Stateful Flutter widgets.




Weâ€™re going to make a Las Vegas dice app. You can make the die roll at the press of a button. 

## What we learned

- Flutter stateless widgets to design the user interface.
- Flutter stateful widgets to update the user interface.

- onClick listeners to detect when buttons are pressed.
-  setState to mark the widget tree as dirty and requiring update on the next render.
